# Higher-Order Structure of the Universe Analysis

## Research Question

**Can we determine whether there is a higher-order structure of the universe through identifying clusters of clusters (or superclusters) of galaxies using the K-means clustering algorithm?**

## Overview

This repository contains the research paper that explores the application of the K-means clustering algorithm to identify clusters of clusters, also known as superclusters, of galaxies. The study aims to determine whether such clustering can reveal insights into the higher-order structure of the universe.
